# sonic-common-utils
This repo contains a utilities library used by the SONiC project for thread queues, mutex support, and  other items. If the code is a utility and used by more then one SONiC component,  the code utility should be placed here.

Examples of this are the event service used by the sonic-object-library. The API that starts, stops, and the infrastructure for events are in the "event" sources while the user is in the sonic-object-library.
